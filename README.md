 I’m @ethereal-coding but my real name is David (I was tired and listening to too much lil uzi when I came up with the username)
 I like all kinds of tech as well as finance and business but I also make music and do other random things  
 I’m currently learning C++ as well as trying to improve my front-end skills 

CONTACT - davidgamanbusiness@gmail.com (not really sure why you'd wanna contact me but go ahead, I got plenty of free time)
