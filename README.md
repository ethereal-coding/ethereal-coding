I’m @ethereal-coding but my real name is David (I was very tired and listening to too much lil uzi when I came up with the username). I like all kinds of tech as well as  finance and business but I also make music and do other random things. I’m currently learning C++ as well as working on my JavaScript so I can make cool stuff. 

CONTACT - davidgamanbusiness@gmail.com (not really sure why you'd wanna contact me but go ahead, I got plenty of free time)
